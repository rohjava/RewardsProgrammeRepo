This is a baisc REST API which uses H2 in memory db as the data source.
Also included a PurchaseApi.postman_collection.json file in the src/main/resouces folder for testing the restapi.
using the default port 8080 for the tomcat server
H2 db console can be accessed when the application is launched and the console url is "http://localhost:8080/h2-console"
H2 DB login credentials are in available in the application.properties file.
Still need to add the validations and error handling and error response. Will add them sub sequently
